# Claw.js

**A GPU accelerated linear algebra library for Node.js.**

## About

There are many libraries for Python for numerical computation, especially for linear algebra e.g. Numpy, PyTorch. Not that many exist for Node.js and to be fair, JavaScript is not the most suitable programming language for the job. But like many people from the JS community, I told myself, why not?

Claw.js uses OpenCL. Yes, yes I know that it's not the best GPGPU API. The reason I wanted to use that instead of CUDA is portability. I don't want Claw.js to be dependant on a specific hardware manufacturer, you should be able to use it with any GPU you have!

### Built with

## Installation

## Usage

## Roadmap

1. Implementation of basic matrix operations in C using OpenCL.
2. Binding the library to Node.js
